# GasTurbine CO and NOx Emission DataSet
in this project we want to predict turbine energy yield (TEY). we have to find a good model for predicting the TEY.we will use some  algorithms to find best model: LinearRegression and Lasso and Ridge.

# dataset information
The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine located in Turkey's north western region for the purpose of studying flue gas emissions, namely CO and NOx (NO + NO2).
